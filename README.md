# HousesBot

## Welcome to the Houses Bot

This is a simple bot made by Stefan Cooper to hold Houses scores 
for the esports society. This will be an interactive way for members
to check how many points their house has.

## To get setup

After cloning the repository into your own directory, you'll need to make 
sure you have installed node.js and have set up a discord bot online. You 
can find instructions on how to do this here: https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/
Once you have set up your auth.json file with your bots' token, navigate 
to the cloned directory and complete the following actions.

`npm install` then 
`node bot.js`

Now if you have correctly installed everything then your bot should be up and running on the server you selected.
